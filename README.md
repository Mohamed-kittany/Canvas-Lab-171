# Creating Amazon EC2 Instances

## Lab Overview

AWS offers several methods to launch Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. In this lab, you will utilize the AWS Management Console to initiate an EC2 instance that will act as a bastion host. Subsequently, you will use this bastion host to launch another EC2 instance designated as a web server. The process involves using EC2 Instance Connect for secure access to the bastion host, followed by employing the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to deploy the web server instance. This lab provides a practical scenario to understand the deployment and management of EC2 instances in a secure and controlled manner.
